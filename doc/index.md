# SkyDocs
SkyDocs is a website where libraries are documented, and some programs as well.  
It contains up to date documentation on various libraries such as `sUtils`.  
It has categories that are separated by project, which are organized alphabetically.  
Every library has a minified version available at https://skydocs.madefor.cc/minified
